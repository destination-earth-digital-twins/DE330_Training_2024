# Some plotting routines

In order to easily plot some results we will use Jupyter Notebooks. 

In order to run Jupyter notebooks on ECMWF's ATOS go to a terminal on your ECMWF desktop (via [desktop.ecmwf.int](https://desktop.ecmwf.int/))
In the terminal run: 

```
ecinteractive -j
```

This will start up a Jupyter notebook running as a 12 hr job on one of the HPC's. More information about the interactive jobs can be found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/HPC2020%3A+Running+an+interactive+job). This also includes info how to increase the number of nodes, or increase the memory of your jobs.
