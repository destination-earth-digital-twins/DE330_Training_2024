# First run exercise 

Follow the instructions for the first Atos example in the [README](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/Deode-Prototype?tab=readme-ov-file#examples). The example is actually equivalent to
```
deode start suite --config-file deode/data/config_files/config.toml
```
or even the simpler
```
deode start suite 
```
why is that? Hint: try the command `deode show config -h`
