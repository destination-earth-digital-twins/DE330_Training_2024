# Visualize the results of your verifications on ATOS through the shiny apps

a) In main.sh, set back to "NO" the previously used variables RUN_POINT_VERIF=no and RUN_POINT_VERIF_LOCAL=no
b) To visualize the dynamic "native" harp shiny app, activate SHOW_WEB_DYNAMIC=yes, run main.sh and follow instructions in the terminal to export the display to visualize the web in firefox
c) To visualize the "static" pngs through a simple shiny app with dropdown menus, activate SHOW_WEB_STATIC=yes, run main.sh and follow instructions in the terminal to export the display to visualize the web in firefox. You might have to change also the port number if the previous visualization was not closed correctly.
