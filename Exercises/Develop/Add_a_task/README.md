# Add a new task

Check the documentation and the presentation by Alex for how to create a new task from scratch [here](https://destination-earth-digital-twins.github.io/deode-workflow-docs/misc_section_in_doc_page.html#adding-a-new-task). Create a task that does a `grib_ls` command on one of your output files from a previous exercise.
