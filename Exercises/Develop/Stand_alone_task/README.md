# Test to run a stand alone task

For development and debugging purposes it's handy to be able to run a task without having to use a scheduler, like ecflow. In the main `README.md` it's described how to run a stand alone task. The simplest task to run is the `PostMortem` task. Try to run this! Should work on you laptop as well...

By default jobs not defined in a special submission group runs as serial jobs. Can you make your job run in the background instead?

If you're interested to run e.g. the Forecast as a stand alone task you'd have the initial data prepared. How should you modify the config file to find the required data from e.g. an already existing experiment?
