# Introducing a plugin

This exercise lets you create a plugin for deode. First read the documentation about [plugins](https://destination-earth-digital-twins.github.io/deode-prototype-docs/misc_section_in_doc_page.html#plug-ins). Your task is to introduce the plugin example to your deode installation and run the suite. Do you also manage to run `Exampletask1` as a stand alone task?
