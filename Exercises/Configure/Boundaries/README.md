# Boundary handling

 * Run with the global DT (ATOS_DT) on the boundaries instead of HRES
 * Couple LAM -> LAM with a frequency of 30 minutes. Note: This exercise only works for HARMONIE-AROME
 * Start your LAM -> LAM run at 03:30 instead of an even hour

Documentation for boundary settings can be found [here](https://destination-earth-digital-twins.github.io/deode-prototype-docs/misc_section_in_doc_page.html#property-config-boundaries)
