# Time to show

Deode has a command line argument `deode show` that gives you information about various parts. Try the various options and

 * Show the full config file and parts of the config file on the screen. Hint: Add a section or `section.subsection` to print a smaller part
 * Show the namelist use for the PGD generation. Hint: Surfex namelists is under `-t surfex`
 * Show the config-schema
 * Check if `deode` recognizes the host. How does this work? Hint: Check the case documentation.
